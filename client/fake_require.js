// Client-side takes a context name and an env. This is really, really
// complicated, so we'll walk through it.
//  - Our goal is to be able to require a file from the client that the
//    server hosts using requirejs.
//  - This means that our normal approach of faking-out require won't work
//    because we won't be in control of the definition of require for
//    anything but the main module.
//  - Instead, we must muck with requirejs itself so that any file we include
//    will get our mucked-with version, and be able to find dependencies that
//    aren't real files, like debug or network.
//  - To do this, we'll create a special requirejs context that contains all
//    of the symbols from the default context, but then also provides the
//    fake dependencies. This way, a bog-standard requirejs call will find
//    the right deps.
//  - The only non-hacky way to force a symbol into a requirejs context is
//    via define with the name as the first parameter. Symbols added in this
//    way go into the most recently created context.
//  - Furthermore, the symbols don't _really_ enter into the context until the
//    next require call after they are defined.
//  - Since such a require call is theoretically async (even though we know
//    all of the deps we are asking for are fake and already loaded), we are
//    forced to deal with a Promise.
//  - Inside of our require, we can resolve the Promise with our requirejs
//    context.
//  - Finally, we have to clean up these contexts, so they don't just occupy
//    all memory forever.
